Run 'make' to produce the executables 'client' and 'server'

The server-client example program is a simple increment counter program
in which the server will increment a variable 'val' every time a client
reads from it.

Instructions to run:

1. Run 'server' program first (this program will run forever)
2. Run 'client' in another window (Client will terminate immediately once it reads 'val' from the server)
3. Run 'client' multiple times to see the variable incremented
